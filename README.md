# LMS-Project

This repository contains the demo and project artifacts for the "Development and Deployment of a Learning Management System (LMS) for Online Education" individual assessment.

Contents:
- public/: static demo pages (index.html, login.html)
- server.js: minimal Express server to serve demo pages
- docs/: project plan, Gantt CSV, and report draft

Quickstart (local):
1. Install Node.js (LTS) from https://nodejs.org/ and ensure `node` and `npm` are on your PATH.
2. From the repository root, install dependencies and start the server:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

3. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 for the demo index page, or http://localhost:3000/login for the login page.

Project artifacts and next steps:
- docs/gantt_chart_data.csv — CSV used to generate the Gantt chart.
- docs/Project_Plan.md — Project plan and scope statement.
- docs/LMS_Project_Report.md — Draft report ready for screenshots and finalization.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a Gantt chart PNG from the CSV and add it to docs/.
- Create the PPTX slides and a finished PDF report.
