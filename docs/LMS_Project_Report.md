# Project Report: Development and Deployment of a Learning Management System (LMS) for Online Education

## Introduction (3 Marks)
The rise of online education necessitates robust Learning Management Systems (LMS) to deliver seamless learning experiences. This report outlines the project plan for developing and deploying an LMS as an individual assessment. The goal is to create a web-based LMS supporting course management, user authentication, content delivery, and progress tracking within 12 weeks. The report includes a scope statement, Gantt chart, risk and issues management strategy, and change request process. GitHub is used for version control, and Jira for task management, with screenshots demonstrating usage. The project will culminate in an oral presentation in Session 12, showcasing understanding via a viva voce assessment.

## Report Layout (2 Marks)
This report is formatted in Arial 12pt font with clear headings and a logical structure. Screenshots of GitHub and Jira will be embedded to demonstrate tool usage. The document adheres to IEEE referencing standards and will be submitted via Turnitin by December 23, 2025.

## Task 1: Project Plan Document (5 Marks)

### 1. Comprehensive Scope Statement
**Objective**: Develop and deploy an LMS for online education with course management, user authentication, content delivery, and progress tracking by Dec 23, 2025.

**Deliverables**:
- Functional web-based LMS (login, course creation, quizzes, progress dashboard).
- Technical documentation (user manuals, system architecture).
- Cloud-hosted system (e.g., AWS).
- Project report and presentation.

**Inclusions**: Front-end/back-end development, cloud hosting, security features, GitHub/Jira usage.

**Exclusions**: Mobile app, payment integration, non-English support.

**Assumptions**: Access to tools (Visual Studio Code, AWS Free Tier), simulated stakeholder feedback.

**Constraints**: Individual work, 12-week timeline, budget (use free tools).

### 2. Gantt Chart
Include `docs/gantt_chart_data.csv` or `docs/gantt_chart.png` (if you export the chart) in the final report.

### 3. Risk and Issues Management Strategy
**Risks**:
- Code Bugs (Likelihood: High, Impact: High) — Mitigation: Unit testing, code reviews.
- Time Overruns (High, High) — Mitigation: Buffer time, prioritisation, weekly reviews.
- Tool Access Issues (Low, Medium) — Mitigation: Use free/alternative tools.
- Cloud Downtime (Low, High) — Mitigation: Use reliable providers and backups.

**Issues Process**:
- Log issues in Jira with clear reproduction steps.
- Triage weekly and assign priority; resolve or escalate if unresolved.

### 4. Change Request Management Process
**Process**:
1. Log change request in Jira, include rationale and impact estimate.
2. Assess impact on scope, timeline, and resources.
3. Approve or reject; record decision in Jira.
4. Implement approved changes in a new GitHub feature branch and update Gantt chart.
5. Document the change in the report.

**Example**: Add quiz module (Impact: +3 days, new DB table). Approve if within buffer.

## Task 2: Configuration Management Tool (5 Marks)
**GitHub**:
- Create a private repository `LMS-Project` with `main`, `develop`, and feature branches.
- Use commits and pull requests for all feature work.
- Include screenshots of commit history, branch list, and merged PRs.

**Jira**:
- Create a Kanban project named `LMS Project` and track tasks through To Do → In Progress → Done.
- Capture screenshots of the board and a task detail page.

## Conclusion (2 Marks)
This report provides a comprehensive plan for developing an LMS, tailored for individual execution. The scope defines clear objectives, the Gantt chart ensures a feasible timeline, and the risk/change processes address challenges. GitHub and Jira ensure industry-standard management. The project is on track for completion by Session 12, with a presentation to demonstrate understanding.
